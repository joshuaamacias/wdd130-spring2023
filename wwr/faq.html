                     this is a good trip for children of all ages. </h4><p style="line-height: 1.55em;">We have found however that <b><em style="color: #4678b9;"> over the age of 8 </em></b> to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).</p> <p style="line-height: 1.55em;"> Common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.55em;">

                    <h4 style="line-height: 1.55em;">How far in advance should I book my trip?</h4>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.55em;">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking <b><em style="color: #4678b9;">a year in advance</em></b>. If you can be more flexible <b><em style="color: #4678b9;">6 months</em></b> in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
